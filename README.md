# otf_api_crud

This is a sample app for the [hubspot-nodejs SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hubspot/api-client). I created an API to access the HubDB and I used the HubSpot Client Library.

## Setup APP
Make sure you have Node >=10.13.0 installed.

## Install
```bash
npm install
```
## Running

```bash
npm run dev
```
You should now be able to navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and use the application.

## Testing

### Create
1. Fill each input on the form.
2. Click on create button.

### Update 
1. Select the row that you want to update.
2. Fill all the inputs. If you do not want to change this parameter, you have to fill it with the same content. 
3. Click on update button.

### Delete
1. Select the row that you want to delete.
2. Click on delete button.

### Delete
Hubspot has two tables, draft and publish. When you have to see all your changes on publish table, click on publish button.
